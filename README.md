# job_website
This is a simple Job Portal backend API built using **FastAPI** and **SQLite**. It allows two types of users â€” **Candidates** and **Recruiters** â€” to interact with job postings, applications, and user authentication securely via JWT tokens.

## Features

### Candidates
- Sign up / Log in
- View all jobs
- Apply to jobs (single or multiple)
- View applied jobs
- Email notification on application

### Recruiters
- Sign up / Log in
- Post new jobs
- View applicants
- Email notification when someone applies

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** SQLite (via SQLAlchemy)
- **Authentication:** JWT (using `python-jose`)
- **Password Hashing:** `passlib` with bcrypt
- **Email Notifications:** Simulated via print (mocked)
